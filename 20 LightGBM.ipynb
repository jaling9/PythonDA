    "重要参数\n",
    "```\n",
    "boosting / boost / boosting_type\n",
    "用于指定弱学习器的类型，默认值为 ‘gbdt’，表示使用基于树的模型进行计算。还可以选择为 ‘gblinear’ 表示使用线性模型作为弱学习器。\n",
    "可选的参数值有：\n",
    "‘gbdt’，使用梯度提升树\n",
    "‘rf’，使用随机森林\n",
    "‘dart’，不太了解，官方解释为 Dropouts meet Multiple Additive Regression Trees\n",
    "‘goss’，使用单边梯度抽样算法，速度很快，但是可能欠拟合。\n",
    "推荐设置为 'gbdt’\n",
    "\n",
    "objective / application\n",
    "用于指定学习任务及相应的学习目标，常用的可选参数值如下：\n",
    "“regression”，使用L2正则项的回归模型（默认值）。\n",
    "“regression_l1”，使用L1正则项的回归模型。\n",
    "“mape”，平均绝对百分比误差。\n",
    "“binary”，二分类。\n",
    "“multiclass”，多分类。\n",
    "\n",
    "num_class\n",
    "用于设置多分类问题的类别个数。\n",
    "\n",
    "min_child_samples\n",
    "叶节点样本的最少数量，默认值20，用于防止过拟合。\n",
    "\n",
    "learning_rate / eta\n",
    "LightGBM 不完全信任每个弱学习器学到的残差值，为此需要给每个弱学习器拟合的残差值都乘上取值范围在(0, 1] 的 eta，设置较小的 eta 就可以多学习几个弱学习器来弥补不足的残差。\n",
    "推荐的候选值为：[0.01, 0.015, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1]\n",
    "\n",
    "max_depth\n",
    "指定树的最大深度，默认值为-1，表示不做限制，合理的设置可以防止过拟合。\n",
    "推荐的数值为：[3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 25]。\n",
    "\n",
    "num_leaves\n",
    "指定叶子的个数，默认值为31，此参数的数值应该小于 2 m a x _ d e p t h 2^{max\\_depth}2 \n",
    "max_depth\n",
    " 。\n",
    "\n",
    "feature_fraction / colsample_bytree\n",
    "构建弱学习器时，对特征随机采样的比例，默认值为1。\n",
    "推荐的候选值为：[0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "bagging_fraction / subsample\n",
    "默认值1，指定采样出 subsample * n_samples 个样本用于训练弱学习器。注意这里的子采样和随机森林不一样，随机森林使用的是放回抽样，而这里是不放回抽样。 取值在(0, 1)之间，设置为1表示使用所有数据训练弱学习器。如果取值小于1，则只有一部分样本会去做GBDT的决策树拟合。选择小于1的比例可以减少方差，即防止过拟合，但是会增加样本拟合的偏差，因此取值不能太低。\n",
    "注意： bagging_freq 设置为非0值时才生效。\n",
    "推荐的候选值为：[0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "bagging_freq / subsample_freq\n",
    "数值型，默认值0，表示禁用样本采样。如果设置为整数 z ，则每迭代 k 次执行一次采样。\n",
    "\n",
    "lambda_l1\n",
    "L1正则化权重项，增加此值将使模型更加保守。\n",
    "推荐的候选值为：[0, 0.01~0.1, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "lambda_l2\n",
    "L2正则化权重项，增加此值将使模型更加保守。\n",
    "推荐的候选值为：[0, 0.1, 0.5, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "min_gain_to_split / min_split_gain\n",
    "指定叶节点进行分支所需的损失减少的最小值，默认值为0。设置的值越大，模型就越保守。\n",
    "推荐的候选值为：[0, 0.05 ~ 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "min_sum_hessian_in_leaf / min_child_weight\n",
    "指定孩子节点中最小的样本权重和，如果一个叶子节点的样本权重和小于min_child_weight则拆分过程结束，默认值为1。\n",
    "推荐的候选值为：[1, 3, 5, 7]\n",
    "\n",
    "metric\n",
    "用于指定评估指标，可以传递各种评估方法组成的list。常用的评估指标如下：\n",
    "‘mae’，用于回归任务，效果与 ‘mean_absolute_error’， ‘l1’ 相同。\n",
    "‘mse’，用于回归任务，效果与 ‘mean_squared_error’， ‘l2’ 相同。\n",
    "‘rmse’，用于回归任务，效果与 ‘root_mean_squared_error’， ‘l2_root’ 相同。\n",

    "xgboost和lightgbm的区别和适用场景\n",
    "\n",
    "参考回答:\n",
    "\n",
    "（1）xgboost采用的是level-wise的分裂策略，而lightGBM采用了leaf-wise的策略，区别是xgboost对每一层所有节点做无差别分裂，可能有些节点的增益非常小，对结果影响不大，但是xgboost也进行了分裂，带来了务必要的开销。 leaft-wise的做法是在当前所有叶子节点中选择分裂收益最大的节点进行分裂，如此递归进行，很明显leaf-wise这种做法容易过拟合，因为容易陷入比较高的深度中，因此需要对最大深度做限制，从而避免过拟合。\n",
    "（2）lightgbm使用了基于histogram的决策树算法，这一点不同与xgboost中的 exact 算法，histogram算法在内存和计算代价上都有不小优势。1）内存上优势：很明显，直方图算法的内存消耗为(#data* #features * 1Bytes)(因为对特征分桶后只需保存特征离散化之后的值)，而xgboost的exact算法内存消耗为：(2 * #data * #features* 4Bytes)，因为xgboost既要保存原始feature的值，也要保存这个值的顺序索引，这些值需要32位的浮点数来保存。2）计算上的优势，预排序算法在选择好分裂特征计算分裂收益时需要遍历所有样本的特征值，时间为(#data),而直方图算法只需要遍历桶就行了，时间为(#bin)\n",
    "\n",
    "（3）直方图做差加速，一个子节点的直方图可以通过父节点的直方图减去兄弟节点的直方图得到，从而加速计算。\n",
    "\n",
    "（4）lightgbm支持直接输入categorical 的feature，在对离散特征分裂时，每个取值都当作一个桶，分裂时的增益算的是”是否属于某个category“的gain。类似于one-hot编码。\n",
    "\n",
    "（5）xgboost在每一层都动态构建直方图，因为xgboost的直方图算法不是针对某个特定的feature，而是所有feature共享一个直方图(每个样本的权重是二阶导),所以每一层都要重新构建直方图，而lightgbm中对每个特征都有一个直方图，所以构建一次直方图就够了。\n",
    "\n",
    "其适用场景根据实际项目和两种算法的优点进行选择。\n",
